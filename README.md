This is a Caeser Cipher program written in C to encrypt a single word.

The original word which you wish to encrypt must be put in a file called text.txt in order for this program to work.
After running the program the user only has to enter an integer value, which is the amount the letters should shift, in order to get the encrypted mesage as an output.
